# Who am I
Hello everybody, My name is Samuel Yazie, I am a Software development student and I live in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

I'm currently a student at MITT, honing my skills in software development. I have loved coding and working with techonology ever since I was introduced to it in the 9th grade. Ever since then, I have expanded my skill sets and I have learned how to use a multitude of coding languages including C#, Python, HTML/CSS and Javascript.

I am constantly on the path of learning expanding my knowledge in the world of programming. I feel very passionite about the field of computer science and would love to one day be able to contribute to it. I will be posting some of my best works and documenting my journey and I would love it if you would follow along.
